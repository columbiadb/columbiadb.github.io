# Future

* rodbrooks AI blogpost discusses the technological reality vs general AI beliefs based on over-abstraction
  * is the beleif/vision based on technology or culture or creativity?  If former, then better understand the technology deeply
* contradictory advice between there is a range (upper and lower bounds) wrt the optimal mode
  * examples:
* presentation
  * first describe how a query plan exuecutes step by step.  it will confuse any audience because there's no purpose
  * then describe by starting with purpose (semantics, why those semantics, and what is important), then qury plan execution makes sense
* presentation
  * robbie's popfactor slides before and after
* writing
  * DNI paper at different stages: NIPS initial submission, thibault's initial outline, my first pass, my second pass using kevin knight's paper, final submission


# Midterm-

Levels of abstraction

* levels
  * many many papers are of the form "it is possible, so we did it".  but why?
  * the technical details defines what is possible
  * what is important defines which technical details to pursue
* the basic assumption in research is that you can figure it out
  * read a paper, understand how it works, understand the implications
  * other classes train you to do this.

# Database Topics in Research and Practice

Dinners

* CS dept can pay for 3 at maxsoha (30 per person)

Projects

* smoke
  * try different one pass compression schemes
  * datacube + lineage.(lineage cubes)
  * multi-block optimization
* alphaclean for image workflow pipeline
* image database where atributes are extracted from images?

  1. I already sent these. 
  2. Let's say 60 min. It will be more lecture style.
  3. Dinner after sounds good. I'll set up my own meetings (I want to limit who I talked to because of faculty application stuff).
  4. Please don't publicize widely :).
