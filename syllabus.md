#### Syllabus is currently in flux

#### Overview

This seminar course is a followup to Introduction to Databases (W4111) and is centered around reading research papers, evaluating ideas in the research papers, and working on a semester-long  [research project](./projects).

Topics will likely include:

* High performance, data-intensive systems (e.g., Spark, HTAP/OLAP, Streaming, ML systems)
* Modern data cleaning (e.g., integration, quantitative cleaning, data fusion)
* Data-intensive visualization (e.g., [DVMS](https://cudbg.github.io/lab/), approximation, exploration)
* Database security and privacy (e.g., encrypted databases, secure querying)
* Collaborative data analytics (e.g., data lakes)

#### Course Expectations

What I expect from You

* Students are expected to *actively participate* in class discussions; participation is mandatory.
* Students should be comfortable reading research papers; you will read, answer questions, and comment on the readings before class.
* Students should be comfortable coding data processing systems;  familiarity with database query execution, some machine learning, and algorithms is expected.
* Students should be comfortable conducting a research project and writing up the results in a research paper format.

<!--For assignments, you allowed 5 penalty free late days to use throughout the semester. One late day equals one 24 hour period after the due date of the assignment. Once you have used your late days, there will be a 20% penalty for each day an assignment is late. You do not need to explictly declare the use of late days; we will assign them to you in a way that is optimal for your grade when different assignments are worth different numbers of points. Late days may not be used for the final project.-->



#### Project (semester long)

You will pursue a [semester long research project](./projects) related to this course.
The project is a significant part of the course grade.

#### Midterm Exam

There will be an in-class written exam on 3/21 (after spring break).
The exam will be long-from questions based on the mandatory readings and topics discussed in class.
It will be closed notes.

#### Paper Questions (every class)

You are expected to write and submit a paper review of the readings before each class, and answer some questions about the readings.  The review should be akin to a conference paper review.  The purpose of the readings is to provide an illustrative example of the research area.  You are encouraged but not required to read the supplemental readings to better understand the materials.  The class reviews must be submitted in Piazza by **9PM EST the day before class**.  Late submissions are given a score of 0 without prior approval.  You may miss submissions for up to **2 lectures**.

Each review **must** answer the following basic questions:

* What was the unmet need or opportunity? (1-2 sentences)
* What were existing approaches and why were they not used? Or could they have been used? (1-3 sentences)
* What was the key technical idea?  Do you buy it?  Could it be used elsewhere?  (1-3 sentences)
* Include 1+ question to ask the speaker.


#### Extra Credit

There will be up to 10% extra credit.  TBA

## Collaboration/Copying Policy

TLDR: do your own work.

You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments, except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to look at anyone else's solution, you are not allowed to look at solutions from previous years, and you are not allowed to look at solutions from other universities. You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use each other's code. The same rule holds for the question assignments: you must write all answers yourself, not look at others' answers, but you can discuss the questions with others at a high level.
You are also not allowed to look for or at solutions to the homeworks on the Internet. You can search for small pieces of code that solve small parts of your homeworks, and you may use tutorials to learn, however if you copy any code from anywhere, we request that you identify the origin in a comment in the code.

Be advised that we will be running all assignments through the MOSS code similarity tool, which is very accurate even after significant amount of obfuscation, so we will identify and report anyone who attempts to breach this rule. We will include in our tests solutions from previous years both from Columbia and elsewhere. Both copy-ers and copy-ees will be punished. You are responsible for protecting your code and homeworks from others and not leaving them lying around in publicly open directories.

Finally, you may discuss the questions for each question assignment with other students, but you may not look at other students' answers. You must write your answers yourself.

#### Paper Presentations

You have the _option_ to present as a group (1-2 people) for one lecture on a topic/paper of your choice (within reason).  The paper(s) you select can be from the list given below.  You are also free to list a paper of your choice as long as it matches the themes of the class.
**This list must be submitted by midnight Feb 1.**

You will be asked to complete three milestones for the presentation. Their purpose is to ensure high presentation quality---it is also a good excuse to practice your presentation skills and get feedback:

1. **2 weeks before your presentation**: present to Professor Wu
2. **1 week before your presentation**: present to two or more classmates and get feedback.  The classmates should send me their notes from the presentation.
3. **Day of class**: give awesome presentation
