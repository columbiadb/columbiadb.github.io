# Talk Notes

* which of the latency, quality, cost tradeoffs do people care about in practice?
  * quality not an issue, elastic scaling is the goal (pooling)
* Nature of the firm?
* at large scale, is it all labeling and transcription/extraction?
* macrotasks to microtasks: relationship with the gig economy
* macrotask vs remote employee vs traditional employee
  * what is the core difference?  
    * mostly context free
    * ask an economist: the contract?  the hiring agency is now a platform?
* Applied Usher to all parts of the interface that require choice?

Dinner: Kevin Raji Cherian



Ethics of crowdsourcing

Applications

* airport security for scanning luggage.
* fake news -- does it scale?  security problem?
* cooking website -- in some sense social networks already "crowdsource".  What's teh difference?
* tracking people across city-wide video cameras
* wisdom of the crowds
* social network + census.  kind of like facebook-wide polls
* power a chat
* fiction aggregator beyond tags and summaries
  * feature extraction, particular topic
  * seems like NLP-based free text input is the hard part


## Notes

Why are the crowd powered algorithms _so simple_?  

* Sort, max, topk, filter, rate, find, ER, cluster, categorization, count, estimate, enumerate, 
* What assumptions were needed to model the problem?

What is the type of problem that crowd-powered algorithms and systems are uniquely meant to solve? Donâ€™t use any jargon

* problems that require knowledge that only humans know. this can be
  * detecting things: we have trained for years to see, hear, taste, touch things that are important or interesting
    * pictures, videos, audio
  * cultural taste and preferences
  * doing things in the real world: moving a chair, testing some bad water, reporting the temperature, giving an opinion
    * surveys!  how is crowdsourcing different?  are they?
* is it better to hire an assistant or a crowd of "micro-assistants"?

Why not a social network like reddit?  why have to pay?

* not inherently enjoyable?
* want reliability -- time, quality
* want privacy -- contracts

Are queries/workflows easy to express?

Imagine and describe the craziest/most impactful application for which crowdsourcing would be a necessary component.
  What does the application do?
  Who cares?
  Why is crowdsourcing needed?

* Does your application rely only on the crowd powered algorithms at the top?

* crowdsourcing qualitative information (impact of policy decisions) across geographically diverse populations
* Issues:
  * biased results
  * biased sampling
    * need a big enough crowd that can hire a "representative" sample
  * completeness
  * errors
  * existing work
    * whitehouse petitions?
    * comments sections
